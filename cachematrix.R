## These functions are analgous to the exemplary makeVector and cachemean functions
## given as examples, rejiggered to work on square matrices, computing an inverse instead of a mean

## Write a short comment describing this function

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
